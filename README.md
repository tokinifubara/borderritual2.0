![Title](Figure\ 5.png)

A 2D side-scroller made in p5.js library as part of a 6 week workshop with Code Liberation at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

In this game, you play Nkechi a migrant passing through the border. She experiences a moment of biometric failure during her border interview, which she has to intervene upon with her trickster tokens. Collect 20 tricskter tokens to beat the biometric system.


Instructions to Play the Game

Setting Up the Game on Your Computer
--------------------------------------------
This game requires a browser with a  [http-server] started in terminal to be played locally.

The simplest method to bypass this is to download and install [atom] and play the game in the [browser plus] add-on.

This is my first try creating a game in Javascript, so it is not optimized properly.

Loading will take a while. Bear with me.
